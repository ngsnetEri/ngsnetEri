# Hi 👋, I'm Ngsnet Hawarya

Cybersecurity and IT Support Professional  
Master's in Cybersecurity | Hands-On Practitioner

I practice ethical hacking and network intrusion testing, and I work on phishing defense, malware analysis, and secure home lab design. I build hands-on labs to research attacks, practice mitigations, and mentor beginners.

I also perform digital forensics and incident response, and I frequently use tools like Kali Linux, Wireshark, Snort, Nmap, and Azure Security to defend systems and investigate incidents.
