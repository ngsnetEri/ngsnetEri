Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ngsnet Hawarya  
Cybersecurity & IT Support Professional | Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) | Masterâ€™s in Cybersecurity

I do hands-on work in phishing defense, malware analysis, secure home lab design, and incident response.
I can demonstrate Wireshark captures, Python scripts, Snort alerts, Kali tools, and Azure security work.

how to show logs, captures, and runnable examples (short)
1. create folders in your repo
   - projects/wireshark
   - projects/python
   - assets (for images / gifs)

2. add example files
   - put your .pcap (or a small sample) at `projects/wireshark/sample.pcap`
   - put screenshots or an explanatory png at `assets/wireshark-screenshot.png`
   - put Python scripts or notebooks at `projects/python/example_script.py` or `projects/python/example_notebook.ipynb`

3. make images / GIFs visible in the README
   - upload `assets/wireshark-screenshot.png`, then reference it:
     `![wireshark screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngsneteri/ngsneteri/main/assets/wireshark-screenshot.png)`
   - for animated terminal demos record a short GIF and add:
     `![terminal demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngsneteri/ngsneteri/main/assets/terminal-demo.gif)`

4. make badges / icons clickable (example)
   - clickable badge that opens your wireshark project folder:
     `[![Wireshark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wireshark-1679A7?logo=wireshark)](https://github.com/ngsneteri/ngsneteri/tree/main/projects/wireshark)`

5. link to raw files or viewers for nicer display
   - raw image: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<username>/<repo>/main/assets/wireshark-screenshot.png`
   - link to pcap so people can download: `https://github.com/ngsneteri/ngsneteri/raw/main/projects/wireshark/sample.pcap`
   - Jupyter notebook viewer: `https://nbviewer.org/github/ngsneteri/ngsneteri/blob/main/projects/python/example_notebook.ipynb`

upload options (web UI - easiest)
- go to your repo â†’ Add file â†’ Upload files
- drag `assets/*` and `projects/*` files, then Commit changes

upload options (git)
- git add ., git commit -m "add projects and assets", git push

extras & tips
- create short README files inside each `projects/*` folder explaining what the sample shows (commands used, pcap summary, suspicious IPs, etc.). That makes click-throughs useful.
- use a GIF for a quick Wireshark walkthrough (e.g., filtering to `http && ip.addr == x.x.x.x`) â€” GIFs show behavior instantly.
- use asciinema to record terminal sessions and embed or link to them (good for showing python scripts running).
- keep sample pcaps small (a few KB/MB) so GitHub handles them easily.

want me to
- generate a ready-to-paste README with these links customized to your repo (I can fill in exact file names), or
- make a sample small `sample.pcap`, a Wireshark screenshot, and example python script and a README for the `projects` folders and provide the markdown to paste?
