Hi All,

Ngsnet Hawarya here — a cybersecurity and IT support professional passionate about ethical hacking, network defense, and digital forensics. I hold a Master of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Cybersecurity from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota.  
I build and manage secure environments for penetration testing, malware analysis, and network intrusion simulation, blending technical expertise with a strong commitment to proactive and defensive security.

Passionate about ethical hacking, network and infrastructure intrusion, penetration testing, and malware analysis.  
Open to collaborations on projects involving programming, ethical hacking defenses, or cloud security.  
Enjoy building home labs, performing forensic analysis, and mentoring others in cybersecurity.
